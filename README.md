# Age-related-climate-response-of-tree-ring-stable-carbon-and-oxygen-isotope
This repository include the data and code for the analyze the age-related climate response in the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes from NW China. The data and code are used in the manuscript "Age-related climate response of tree-ring d13C and d18O from spruce in northwestern China, with implications for relative humidity reconstructions" submitted in Journal of Geophysical Research-Biogeoscience. The aunthors include Guobao Xu, Guoju Wu, Xiaohong Liu, Tuo Chen, Bo Wang, Amy Hudson, Valerie Trouet.

All of the code are run in R 3.5 under window system. To run the code, we need to change your workspace. Then  run the my funtion file firstly.
If you have any questions about the data and analysis, please contact me through email xgb234@lzb.ac.cn or guobaoxu@email.arizona.edu.
